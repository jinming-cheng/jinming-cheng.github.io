I did my PhD with Professor [Gordon Smyth](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=k1z6axEAAAAJ&hl=en) and Dr [Yunshun Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rIeDs2sAAAAJ&hl=en) on analyzing single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data of breast cancer at Bioinformatics Division in Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, The University of Melbourne. During my PhD, I worked closely with my collaborators in the [Breast Cancer Laboratory](https://www.wehi.edu.au/laboratory/breast-cancer-laboratory/) including Dr Somayeh (Somi) Kordafshari, Xiaoyu (Shirley) Song, Dr [Rosa Pascual](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AJYK0kIAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof [Jane Visvader](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=dyAm7HMAAAAJ&hl=en). My PhD project was mainly focused on analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing data of normal mammary gland and breast cancer, including mouse mammary fibroblasts and epithelium, traditional human breast cancer subtypes (ER/PR+, HER2+ and TNBC) and rare human breast cancer subtypes (MpBC, IMPC, LAR, MED, PLC). We aimed to understand cell lineage commitment of mammary gland and mechanisms of breast cancer genesis and development. Besides, I worked on single-cell RNA sequencing data of skin and liver tissues with Prof [Naiyang Fu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ujBX2REAAAAJ&hl=en), Dr. Hui San Chin and Dr. Chow Hiang Ang. In addition, we developed new methods to help interpret the single-cell RNA sequencing data of breast cancer and other tissues.
