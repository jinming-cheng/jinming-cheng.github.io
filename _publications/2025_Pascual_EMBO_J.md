Fibroblasts form a major component of the stroma in normal mammary tissue and breast tumors. Here, we have applied longitudinal single-cell transcriptome profiling of >45,000 fibroblasts in the mouse mammary gland across five different developmental stages and during oncogenesis. In the normal gland, diverse stromal populations were resolved, including lobular-like fibroblasts, committed preadipocytes and adipogenesis-regulatory, as well as cycling fibroblasts in puberty and pregnancy. These specialized cell types appear to emerge from CD34^high^ mesenchymal progenitor cells, accompanied by elevated Hedgehog signaling. During late tumorigenesis, heterogeneous cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) were identified in mouse models of breast cancer, including a population of CD34^–^ myofibroblastic CAFs (myCAFs) that were transcriptionally and phenotypically similar to senescent CAFs. Moreover, Wnt9a was demonstrated to be a regulator of senescence in CD34^–^ myCAFs. These findings reflect a diverse and hierarchically organized stromal compartment in the normal mammary gland that provides a framework to better understand fibroblasts in normal and cancerous states.
