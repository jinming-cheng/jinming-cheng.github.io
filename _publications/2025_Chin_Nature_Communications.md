This study demonstrates the pivotal role of MCL‑1 in inhibiting proliferation stress‑induced apoptosis when quiescent stem cells activate to fuel tissue regeneration. Constitutive *Mcl‑1* deletion does not impair hair follicle organogenesis but leads to gradual hair loss and elimination of hair follicle stem cells. Acute *Mcl‑1* deletion rapidly depletes activated hair follicle stem cells and completely blocks depilation‑induced hair regeneration in adult mice, while quiescent hair follicle stem cells remain unaffected. Single‑cell RNA‑seq profiling reveals the engagement of P53 and DNA mismatch repair signaling in hair follicle stem cells upon depilation‑induced activation. Remarkably, the loss of a single *Bak* allele, a pro‑apoptotic *Bcl‑2* effector gene, rescues *Mcl‑1* deletion‑induced defects in both hair follicles and mammary glands.
