excerpt: 'This paper reveals for the first time that there are only two major hepatocyte populations in normal mouse liver: Cyp2e1+ (pericentral) and Gls2+ (periportal), which suggests liver has 2 zones rather than traditionally thought 3 zones.'

We found that the liver lobule can be divided into two major zonal and molecular hepatocyte populations marked by *Cyp2e1* or *Gls2*. Pericentral *Cyp2e1*+ and periportal *Gls2*+ hepatocytes maintain their own lineage during adult homeostasis, while *Cyp2e1*+ hepatocytes fuel neonatal liver growth. The *Gls2*+ and *Cyp2e1*+ populations can rapidly regenerate one another when one of the populations is severely damaged. Midlobular *Ccnd1*+ hepatocytes are enriched in the *Cyp2e1*+ zone in adult liver but have limited contributions to regeneration upon partial hepatectomy and severe pericentral injury. Remarkably, *Lgr5*+ hepatocytes, a unique *Cyp2e1*+ subset, contribute significantly to liver replenishment upon periportal injuries.
